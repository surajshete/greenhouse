            <p>   A greenhouse (also called a glasshouse, or, if with sufficient heating, a hothouse) is a structure  with walls and roof made chiefly of transparent material, such as glass, in which plants requiring regulated climatic conditions are grown. These structures range in size from small sheds to industrial-sized buildings. A miniature greenhouse is known as a cold frame. The interior of a greenhouse exposed to sunlight becomes significantly warmer than the external temperature, protecting its contents in cold weather. </p>

                <p>Many commercial glass greenhouses or hothouses are high tech production facilities for vegetables, flowers or fruits. The glass greenhouses are filled with equipment including screening installations, heating, cooling, lighting, and may be controlled by a computer to optimize conditions for plant growth. Different techniques are then used to evaluate optimality-degrees and comfort ratio of greenhouseate (i.e., air temperature, relative humidity and vapor pressure deficit) in order to reduce production risk prior to cultivation of a specific crop.

            <h2>Why Different Greenhouse Designs for Different Climates?</h2>

            <p> Not all greenhouses are created equal—a design that works well in a cool climate with long cold winters, snowfall, low light and high winds will not be the best design for a humid, tropical climate with variable light intensity.Different greenhouses are characterized by the level of protection from the outside environment they can offer and the capability they can provide growers to control the inside environment to a specific set of conditions. </p>

            <p>The level of protection required depends on the type of crop being grown and the local climate. The objective with building any greenhouse is to find a design that will allow the grower to overcome the most limiting climatic problems in their particular area and obtain the maximum growth rates possible from their crops.</p>

            <div class="work-experience">
              <p>
                 The technological development in Smart greenhouses has come so far that we no longer can do without a smart computer to control our greenhouses. Similar to the computers in modern vehicles and airplanes, the greenhouse computer allows for the most efficient way to operate in. Intelligent controls create the optimal growing climate in respect to energy use, water usage and nutrients. By taking the costs of these recourses into account, the greenhouse computer does not only create the best circumstances for your crop to grow, it significantly cuts on operational expenses .greenhouses may require cooling systems. This occurs when the daily average temperature is too high for the crops to function properly. In this case, cooling the greenhouse is the only way to keep the crops inside healthy and productive. Cooling a greenhouse is more expensive than heating a greenhouse. An investment in a cooling system must therefore be a well considered decision .There are two systems which use this principle in commercial greenhouses: high pressure fogging and the Pad & Fan cooling system. In the few years, semi-closed greenhouses have been developed based on the same principles as the Pad & Fan system.</p>
